# Dissertation Study Three
## Longitudinal secondary data analysis on assortative mating

This study aims to examine potential matching patterns in personality traits
and relationship-specific characteristic adaptations (CAs) such as attachment patterns, caregiving
systems, conflict resolution, partner responsiveness, and trust. We are using secondary data
analysis from two existing longitudinal studies of complementary samples: early dating couples
and established couples during the first two years of parenthood. We will examine broad patterns
of similarity both statically at baseline and dynamically as participants may vary across the
different waves. Further, we will examine potential benefits of this matching pattern with respect
to relationship quality
